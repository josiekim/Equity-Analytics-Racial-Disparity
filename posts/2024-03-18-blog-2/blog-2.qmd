#Data Background
Where does the data come from? Who collected it? Why was it collected? Are you able to find the data from the original source?

Are there any issues you can see with how the data was collected? What is the sample population? Are there reasons to think the sample is biased in some way?
How is this data used? Has there been other research on the same data? Is this data being used for some policy decisions? What questions have others ask about this data?

#Data Loading and Cleaning
The "Child Opportunity Levels, Scores and averaged z-scores for the overall index and three domains" data set is 33mb. For this reason, we did not need to start with a subset of the data. We decided to start the cleaning process by getting rid of the "c5_ED_met", "c5_HE_met", "c5_SE_met", "c5_COI_met", "r_ED_met", "r_HE_met", "r_SE_met", "r_COI_met". This is because the majority of values in these columns were left blank. Column "in100" also contains blanks. But after looking at the provided Data Dictionary, we saw that the blanks in this columns are assigned a value and represent whether cencus tract is located outside a metro or micro-politan area.

If you are working with a large data set, you would need to start with a subset of the data. How did you choose this? Are you starting by removing missing values or focusing on columns with less missing data.

Work on these first steps of data cleaning. Note, you can always adjust your data cleaning process later. Also, recall that an important part of cleaning is doing some basic exploratory data analysis to look for things like unusual values, unusually frequent values, unusually infrequent values, relationships that you expect to be in the data, etc. In your blog post, include one plot or table to show that you are looking into these potential issues.
