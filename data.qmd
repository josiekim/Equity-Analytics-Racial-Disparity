# Data Background

## Data Set 1: Child Opportunity Index

Link:
https://data.diversitydatakids.org/dataset/coi20-child-opportunity-index-2-0-database
The Child Opportunity Index 2.0 (COI 2.0) is a comprehensive tool
developed in collaboration with the Kirwan Institute for the Study of
Race and Ethnicity at Ohio State University, released in January 2020.
It measures neighborhood-level resources and conditions essential for a
child's healthy development across the United States. The COI is a
composite index of child's neighborhood opportunity that contains data
for every neighborhood (census tract) in the United States from every
year for 2012 through 2021. It is comprised of 44 indicators in three
domains (education, health and environment, and social and economic) and
14 sub-domains. COI 2.0 compiles data from state and federal sources.
This comprehensive data collection process examines approximately 72,000
neighborhood conditions crucial for a child's well-being, including
school quality, green space availability, air quality, and adult
employment levels. The resulting Child Opportunity Score, ranging from 1
to 100, provides insight into each U.S. neighborhood and metro area's
position in the national child opportunity landscape, aiming to
spotlight disparities within the largest 100 U.S. metros. Particularly,
it reveals significant racial inequities with implications for a child's
health, education, and life expectancy.

## Data Set 2: Raw Indicator Values

The component indicators data for COI 2.0 is a comprehensive collection
of demographic data and raw indicator values from the American Community
Survey (ACS) covering the years 2010 and 2015, correlating to the ACS
5-year data from 2008-12 and 2013-17 respectively. Most of the data
points related to geographical and demographic information are
structured to be similar to our original data set. Notably, this data
set also includes raw numeric values for educational and socioeconomic
data such as college enrollment in nearby institutions (’ED_COLLEGE’)
and poverty rate(’SE_POVRATE’).

This data set serves as a critical tool for understanding demographic
distributions and trends, which will aid our analysis of the Child
Opportunity Index.

## Data Set 3: Child Population Data

Link:
https://data.diversitydatakids.org/dataset/coi20-child-opportunity-index-2-0-database/resource/44ee1ea6-a3df-4af3-93b7-c4695d5ab6a6

The “Child population data - Number of children aged 0-17 years by
race/ethnicity from the American Community Survey” uses Census data to
describe the demographic of a micro regional area, including whether the
area is one of the 100 largest metro areas in the U.S. The data set
includes the racial composition of the area broken down by proportions
of children belonging to each race group.

We will use this data set to help inform our analysis of the strength of
select indicators in computing the overall Child Opportunity Index.

To add more insight on the data, we will be using 3 different data files
under the COI 2.0, which are the index data, child population data, and
component indicators data respectively. There are 8 variables that are
present in all 3 data sets, which, in essence, represent the
geographical location of each metropolitan area. Some important
variables to highlight in these data sets are the population of each
race group per metro area, health insurance coverage, poverty rate, and
median household income. We will keep a close eye on these features to
see how they affect a child’s overall opportunity.

Below, we created a graphics with the variable `college_enrollment` to
show the distribution across race and region.

## Average College Enrollment by Race and Region

![](images/clipboard-3630215259.png)

We decided to visualize the average college enrollment across race and
region due to the growing weight having a college degree holds in
society. Obtaining a college degree is necessary for a majority of
careers as it shows that they are an educated and hard working person.
It's considered a threshold for success, and is a result of the
opportunities children had growing up.

As seen by the bar graphs, White people consistently have high college
enrollment status across the 4 regions. On the other hand, Aian (Native
American and Alaska Native) hold the lowest numbers. The reappearing
pattern of White and Hispanic students having higher college enrollment
numbers compared to the other races is something we found intriguing and
hope to explore further.

## Data Cleaning Process

In the first step of our data cleaning process, we used `read.csv` to
access our 3 data sets `childpop_race.csv`, `rawindicators.csv`, and
`index.csv`. Then, in order to narrow the scope of our analysis, we used
`filter(year != 2010)` to isolate data from the year 2010. We decided to
merge all 3 data sets on `geoid` using `inner_join` since it was present
in all 3 data sets.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
library(tidymodels)
library(broom)

childpop <- read_csv('dataset/childpop_race.csv', show_col_types = FALSE)
indicators <- read_csv('dataset/rawindicators.csv', show_col_types = FALSE)
index <- read_csv('scripts/index/index.csv', show_col_types = FALSE)

childpop <- childpop |>
  filter(year != 2010)
indicators <- indicators |>
  filter(year != 2010)
index <- index |>
  filter(year != 2010)

merged_df <- inner_join(childpop, indicators, by = "geoid") |>
  distinct()
cleaned_merged_df <- inner_join(merged_df, index, by = "geoid") |>
  distinct()
```

Upon merging all 3 data sets, we had an abundance of duplicated columns.
We selected the duplicated columns and placed a negative sign, `-`,
before the column name to indicate it's being removed.

```{r}
cleaned_merged_df <- select(cleaned_merged_df, -year, -in100, -statefips, -stateusps, -pop, -year.y, -msaname15.y, -in100.y, -countyfips.y, -statefips.y, -pop.y, -msaid15.y, -stateusps.y, -countyfips, -pop.x, -msaid15, -msaname15)
```

Additionally, we renamed the columns using `rename()` to clearly show
what the columns are representing. The original column names were
difficult to interpret and we found ourselves referring to the data
dictionary often. Certain variables, such as `z_COI_nat`, we decided to
keep as is since changing the names to describe the data would make the
column names long and repetitive. Instead, we decided to include a
simplified version of the data dictionary in our `Data` page under
`Data Set 1: Child Opportunity Index`.

In the last step of our data cleaning process, we removed any null
values in the data. We removed the rows that contained the null values
by counting and summing the null rows and then omitting them with
`na.omit()`. We also grouped the different states (including Washington
D.C.) by Northwest, Northeast, South, and West regions into a new data
frame called `region_data`. Additionally, we grouped the different
racial groups by state to get a total of the different race populations
per state to better visualize the distribution of race populations per
state.

```{r}
na_rows_count <- sum(!complete.cases(cleaned_merged_df))
cleaned_data <- na.omit(cleaned_merged_df)
```

## Load Data

In our `load_and_clean_data.R` file, the code snippet utilizes the
`tidyverse` package to handle data manipulation and analysis tasks
efficiently. It reads in a RData file named `cleaned_merged_dg.RData`
located within the `datasets` directory using the `load()` function. The
cleaned data is saved as an `.rds` file named `cleaned_merged_df.rds` in
the `scripts` directory using the `saveRDS` function. This ensures that
the cleaned data set can be easily accessed and shared for future
analyses. Additionally, the `readRDS` function is used to read the saved
`.rds` file, enabling the retrieval of the cleaned data set for further
processing or exploration.

```{r}
source(
  "scripts/load_and_clean_data.R",
  echo = TRUE # Use echo=FALSE or omit it to avoid code output  
)
```
