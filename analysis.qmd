## Rubric: On this page

You will

-   Introduce what motivates your Data Analysis (DA)
    -   Which variables and relationships are you most interested in?
    -   What questions are you interested in answering?
    # how does child's housing environment (food access, greenspace access, heat exposure, ozone concentration, airborne microparticles, walkability, waste dump sites, industrial pollutants) impact child's success (z_HE_nat)
    # how does child's social environment (housing vacancy rate, poverty rate, public assistant rate, home ownership rate, high skill employment, med house income, employment rate) impact z_SE_nat
    # how does child's education environment (AP enrollment, adult education attainment, college enrollment, early child enrollment, HS grad, math prof, reading prof, school pov, teacher_exp, edu centers, high quality edu centers) impact z_ED_RATE 
   
    -   Provide context for the rest of the page. This will include figures/tables that illustrate aspects of the data of your question.
-   Modeling and Inference
    -   The page will include some kind of formal statistical model. This could be a linear regression, logistic regression, or another modeling framework.
    # linear reg: poverty vs COI z score
    # logistic reg NEEDED
    
    -   Explain the ideas and techniques you used to choose the predictors for your model. (Think about including interaction terms and other transformations of your variables.)
    # can use intuition and info from visualizations
    
    -   Describe the results of your modelling and make sure to give a sense of the uncertainty in your estimates and conclusions.
-   Explain the flaws and limitations of your analysis
    -   Are there some assumptions that you needed to make that might not hold? Is there other data that would help to answer your questions?
-   Clarity Figures
    -   Are your figures/tables/results easy to read, informative, without problems like overplotting, hard-to-read labels, etc?
    -   Each figure should provide a key insight. Too many figures or other data summaries can detract from this. (While not a hard limit, around 5 total figures is probably a good target.)
    -   Default `lm` output and plots are typically not acceptable.
-   Clarity of Explanations
    -   How well do you explain each figure/result?
    -   Do you provide interpretations that suggest further analysis or explanations for observed phenomenon?
-   Organization and cleanliness.
    -   Make sure to remove excessive warnings, hide most or all code, organize with sections or multiple pages, use bullets, etc.
    -   This page should be self-contained, i.e. provide a description of the relevant data.
