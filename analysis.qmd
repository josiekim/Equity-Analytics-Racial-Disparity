We are interested in seeing how the distribution of z-scores varies
across the United States. So we decided to split the cleaned data into
regions rather than state by using the `case_when()` function.
Organizing the data by region facilitates easier comparisons and
provides a clearer understanding of the `` z_COI_nat` `` trends. We
chose to create a bar graph of the weighted averages of the `z_COI_nat`
data by region.

# Distribution of Average COI Z-Score by Region

Since the Northeast region has the highest mean z-score and South has
the lowest, we are focusing our analysis on these 2 regions. By graphing
histograms and various linear models, we are interested in seeing how
social and economic, health and environment, and education factors
impact COI scores.

Based on the distributions, high skill employment is the most normal.
This indicates a moderate level of high skilled employment across the
region. As a result, high skilled employment does not seem to have any
major impact on the z-score since regions with disproportionately low
levels of high skilled employment may experience higher levels of
socioeconomic challenges. A skewed distribution such as employment rate
stands out as a variable that heavily impacts the z-score. Employment
rate is skewed to the left. The distribution suggests that a significant
proportion of the population is employed and the Northeast region has a
robust economy. Although poverty rate, housing vacancy rate, and public
assistant rate are skewed right shows that most areas in the Northeast
have low instances of these cases. This aligns with our Distribution by
Average z-score by Region table which shows Northeast with the highest
scores.

The South region follows the same pattern as the Northeast region. From
analyzing the employment rate visual, the concentration of employment
could also suggest challenges for unemployed individuals. This could
potentially lead to issues such as income inequality. This is evident in
the right skewed distribution of the median housing income graph. It
shows that most of the population earns a lower income. This could be
the reason the South region has a significantly lower z-score than the
Northeast.

In order to determine which variable has the highest impact on the
dependent variable (z_COI_nat), we decided to run a regression to
examine the magnitude of the coefficients. The larger the absolute value
of the coefficient, the stronger the impact of that variable on the
dependent variable, holding other variables constant. Looking at the
coefficients, the variable `employ_rate` has the largest (absolute
value) coefficient, with an estimate of 8.193e-04. This suggests that
for every unit increase in the employment rate, the z_COI_nat increases
by approximately 8.193e-04 units, assuming all other variables remain
constant. Additionally, `med_house_income` also has a substantial
coefficient (1.676e-07), indicating that for every unit increase in
median household income, the z_COI_nat increases by approximately
1.676e-07 units, holding other variables constant. This confirms our
interpretations of the histograms for why Northeast has the highest
z-scores and why South has the lowest.

## Linear Models for Weighted Average of Social and Economic Domain z-scores, Nationally Normed

Residuals vs Fitted Plot: This plot helps to check the assumption of
linearity and homoscedasticity in a regression model. Ideally, the
residuals will be randomly distributed to indicate a good model fit.
Here, the residuals seem to be relatively evenly distributed around the
horizontal line, but a slight fan shape suggests potential
heteroscedasticity, where the variance of the residuals increases as the
fitted values increase.

Normal Q-Q Plot: This plot is used to check the normality of residuals.
The points should lie approximately along the reference line if the
residuals are normally distributed. In this plot, most points align well
with the line except for a slight deviation at the tails. This suggests
that the residuals are mostly normal but with some possible deviations
from normality at the extremes.

Scale-Location Plot: Similar to the first plot, this one also checks for
homoscedasticity by plotting the square roots of the standardized
residuals against the fitted values. The relatively constant spread
across the range of fitted values suggests that variance is fairly
constant (homoscedasticity), although, like the Residuals vs Fitted
plot, there appears to be a slight increase in spread for higher fitted
values. Another similarity is the presence of outliers, which suggest
atypical levels of heteroscedasticity for those points.

Cook's Distance Plot: This plot shows the influence of each observation
on the fitted values. Observations with a Cook's distance much larger
than others can be considered influential to the model. Here, all
observations have relatively low Cook's distances, suggesting that no
single observation is overly influential. Overall, the model shows a
reasonable fit with some signs of potential heteroscedasticity and
slight deviations from normality at the extremes. The lack of
influential outliers is a good sign for the robustness of the model.

# Education Domain Factors

Analyzing the histograms of key education indicators for the Northeast
and South regions, several patterns emerge that align with broader
socioeconomic trends and disparities between these areas.

In the Northeast, histograms such as adult education attainment, college
enrollment, and education centers suggest a robust educational
infrastructure with moderate to high levels of engagement and
attainment. For instance, the distribution of adult education attainment
and college enrollment both exhibit a normal-like distribution, centered
around moderate levels. This indicates a balanced distribution of
educational levels, which likely contributes to a stronger economy and
higher employment rates. The histogram for education centers, which is
slightly skewed towards higher numbers, further supports the
availability of educational resources. Such distributions align with a
more robust economic environment where higher education levels and
resource availability contribute positively to socioeconomic stability.

Conversely, the South shows a different pattern. The histograms for the
same indicators display significant right skewness, especially in math
proficiency and school poverty rates. These distributions suggest lower
levels of achievement and higher instances of poverty within schools.
The histogram for adult education attainment in the South also shows a
pronounced decline as educational levels increase, indicating fewer
adults achieve higher education levels. These educational challenges are
mirrored in socioeconomic conditions, as reflected by lower median
household incomes and a higher percentage of school-associated poverty.

Building on the examination of educational indicators using histographs,
we conducted a regression analysis to determine which variables
significantly impact the dependent variable (z_COI_nat). Among the
independent variables, the variable `prop_nonwhite` exhibits the most
significant impact with a coefficient of -0.02019, indicating that a
unit increase in the proportion of the nonwhite population is associated
with a decrease of approximately 0.02019 in the z_COI_nat, holding other
variables constant. Similarly, the variable `school_pov` has a
substantial negative coefficient of -0.0002494, suggesting that an
increase in the school poverty rate by one unit leads to a decrease in
z_COI_nat by roughly the same magnitude. In contrast, variables such as
`HS_gradrate` and `adult_edu_attainment`, with coefficients of 0.0001139
and 0.0006891 respectively, show that higher levels of educational
attainment correspond to positive increments in z_COI_nat.

Residuals vs Fitted Plot: This plot helps to check the assumption of
linearity and homoscedasticity in a regression model. Ideally, the
residuals will be randomly distributed to indicate a good model fit. In
this plot, the residuals appear to be somewhat randomly distributed,
although there is a slight pattern indicating potential non-linearity or
heteroscedasticity, where variances of residuals are not constant across
the range of fitted values.

Normal Q-Q Plot: This plot helps assess whether the residuals are
normally distributed, a key assumption in linear regression. The points
in this plot follow the theoretical line closely in the central part but
deviate slightly in the tails, suggesting some light deviations from
normality, particularly with extreme values, which could be outliers or
influential points affecting the regression model.

Scale-Location Plot: This plot also checks for homoscedasticity by
plotting the square roots of the standardized residuals against the
fitted values. If the variances of residuals are equal across all levels
of the independent variables (homoscedasticity), the spread of residuals
in this plot should be roughly constant across the range of fitted
values. Here, the plot shows a cluster of points with a fairly
consistent spread, suggesting that our model meets the assumption of
equal variance reasonably well.

Cook's Distance Plot: This plot identifies influential cases that might
overly influence the regression model. Points with a Cook’s distance
greater than a critical value (commonly 1 or 0.5) are considered
potentially influential. The plot here shows most data points have low
Cook's distances, indicating that no single observation overly
influences the overall model fit.

As we take a closer look at the distribution of Key health and Economics
indicators. The histograms for the Northeast region and the South region
display a similar pattern. Based on the distribution of Key Health and
However, there is a significant disparity between those two regions in
terms of airborne micro particles factor. In the south region the
distribution of this variable is more normal than the northeast region.
Indicating the seasonality differences between those regions. On the
other hand, the heat exposure distribution of the 2 regions also
suggests a significant difference. As we noted, the attainment to health
insurance is highly left skewed for both region. This skewed
distribution suggests that the variable has a significant impact on the
z score. For the green space access, the south region has higher
variance than the northeast region suggesting that the green space
access may be considered as a more influential factor in northeast
region

Residuals vs Fitted Plot: The plot is used to exam the linearity and
homoscedasticity. Based on the graph presented, there is no unequal
variance. However, there are some of points that lies outside of the
plot, suggesting possible outliers.

Normal N-Q-Q Plot: This plot is used to test the residuals, as we can
see from the graph the N-Q-Q plot for the health and environment domain,
most of the cloud point lies on the line, suggesting a normal
distribution.

Scale - Location Plot: Despite of some obvious outliers, the plot
displays a constant spread across the plot, indicating homoscedasticity.
We can see a horizontal line with equally random point, suggesting our
model's robustness.

Cook Distance Plot: For detecting influential observations, we use cook
distance plot, as we can see from the plot, the overall cook distance is
small indicating that there is no potential strongly influential
observations. At the same time, the plot prove the homoscedasticity and
no obvious outliers for the health and environment domain.
