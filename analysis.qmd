We are interested in seeing how the distribution of z-scores varies
across the United States. So we decided to split the cleaned data into
regions rather than state by using the `case_when()` function.
Organizing the data by region faciliates easier comparisons and provides
a clearer understanding of the `` z_COI_nat` `` trends. We chose to
create a bar graph of the weighted averages of the `z_COI_nat` data by
region.

# Distribution of Average COI Z-Score by Region

Since the Northeast region has the highest mean z-score and South has
the lowest, we are focusing our analysis on these 2 regions. By graphing
histograms and various linear models, we are interested in seeing how
social and economic, health and environment, and education factors
impact COI scores.

The graphics below display a set of histograms for key indicators of
social and economic domain in the Northeast and South region. These
indicators include employment rate, high skill employment, home
ownership, housing vacancy rate, median house income, poverty rate, and
public assistant rate.

Based on the distributions, high skill employment is the most normal.
This indicates a moderate level of high skilled employment across the
region. As a result, high skilled employment does not seem to have any
major impact on the z-score since regions with disproportionately low
levels of high skilled employment may experience higher levels of
socioeconomic challenges. A skewed distribution such as employment rate
stands out as a variable that heavily impacts the z-score. Employment
rate is skewed to the left. The distribution suggests that a significant
proportion of the population is employed and the Northeast region has a
robust economy. Although poverty rate, housing vacancy rate, and public
assistant rate are skewed right shows that most areas in the Northeast
have low instances of these cases. This aligns with our Distribution by
Average z-score by Region table which shows Northeast with the highest
scores.

The South region follows the same pattern as the Northeast region. From
analyzing the employment rate visual, the concentration of employment
could also suggest challenges for unemployed individuals. This could
potentially lead to issues such as income inequality. This is evident in
the right skewed distribution of the median housing income graph. It
shows that most of the population earns a lower income. This could be
the reason the South region has a significantly lower z-score than the
Northeast.

In order to determine which variable has the highest impact on the
dependent variable (z_COI_nat), we decided to run a regression to
examine the magnitude of the coefficients. The larger the absolute value
of the coefficient, the stronger the impact of that variable on the
dependent variable, holding other variables constant. Looking at the
coefficients, the variable `employ_rate` has the largest (absolute
value) coefficient, with an estimate of 8.193e-04. This suggests that
for every unit increase in the employment rate, the z_COI_nat increases
by approximately 8.193e-04 units, assuming all other variables remain
constant. Additionally, `med_house_income` also has a substantial
coefficient (1.676e-07), indicating that for every unit increase in
median household income, the z_COI_nat increases by approximately
1.676e-07 units, holding other variables constant. This confirms our
interpretations of the histograms for why Northeast has the highest
z-scores and why South has the lowest.

Residuals vs Fitted Plot: This plot helps to check the assumption of
linearity and homoscedasticity in a regression model. Ideally, the
residuals will be randomly distributed to indicate a good model fit.
Here, the residuals seem to be relatively evenly distributed around the
horizontal line, but a slight fan shape suggests potential
heteroscedasticity, where the variance of the residuals increases as the
fitted values increase.

Normal Q-Q Plot: This plot is used to check the normality of residuals.
The points should lie approximately along the reference line if the
residuals are normally distributed. In this plot, most points align well
with the line except for a slight deviation at the tails. This suggests
that the residuals are mostly normal but with some possible deviations
from normality at the extremes.

Scale-Location Plot: Similar to the first plot, this one also checks for
homoscedasticity by plotting the square roots of the standardized
residuals against the fitted values. The relatively constant spread
across the range of fitted values suggests that variance is fairly
constant (homoscedasticity), although, like the Residuals vs Fitted
plot, there appears to be a slight increase in spread for higher fitted
values. Another similarity is the presence of outliers, which suggest
atypical levels of heteroscedasticity for those points.

Cook's Distance Plot: This plot shows the influence of each observation
on the fitted values. Observations with a Cook's distance much larger
than others can be considered influential to the model. Here, all
observations have relatively low Cook's distances, suggesting that no
single observation is overly influential. Overall, the model shows a
reasonable fit with some signs of potential heteroscedasticity and
slight deviations from normality at the extremes. The lack of
influential outliers is a good sign for the robustness of the model.
