We are interested in seeing how the distribution of z-scores varies
across the United States. So we decided to split the cleaned data into
regions rather than state by using the `case_when()` function.
Organizing the data by region faciliates easier comparisons and provides
a clearer understanding of the `` z_COI_nat` `` trends. We chose to
create a bar graph of the weighted averages of the `z_COI_nat` data by
region.

# Distribution of Average COI Z-Score by Region

Since the Northeast region has the highest mean z-score and South has
the lowest, we are focusing our analysis on these 2 regions. By graphing
histograms and various linear models, we are interested in seeing how
social and economic, health and environment, and education factors
impact COI scores.

The graphics below display a set of histograms for key indicators of
social and economic domain in the Northeast and South region. These
indicators include employment rate, high skill employment, home
ownership, housing vacancy rate, median house income, poverty rate, and
public assistant rate.

Based on the distributions, high skill employment is the most normal.
This indicates a moderate level of high skilled employment across the
region. As a result, high skilled employment does not seem to have any
major impact on the z-score since regions with disproportionately low
levels of high skilled employment may experience higher levels of
socioeconomic challenges. A skewed distribution such as employment rate
stands out as a variable that heavily impacts the z-score. Employment
rate is skewed to the left. The distribution suggests that a significant
proportion of the population is employed and the Northeast region has a
robust economy. This aligns with our Distribution by Average z-score by
Region table which shows Northeast with the highest scores.

However, the concentration of employment could also suggest challenges
for unemployed individuals, potentially leading to issues such as income
inequality. This is evident in the right skewed distribution of the
median housing income graph. It shows that most of the population earns
a lower income. Despite the fact that poverty rate, housing vacancy
rate, and public assistant rate are skewed right, this actually shows
that most areas in the Northeast have low instances of these cases. This
supports the idea that the Northeast is a socially and economically
strong. To get a deeper understanding of which of these variables have
the greatest impact on z-scores, we will be comparing the t-stats.

The South region follows an identical pattern to that of the Northeast.

This chart is a scale-location plot, typically used in regression
analysis to assess the assumption of homoscedasticity, which is that the
variances of the residuals are constant across all levels of the
independent variables. The y-axis represents the square root of the
standardized residuals from a regression model, highlighting how
residuals deviate from their mean. The x-axis is the predicted values
obtained from the regression model.

Ideally, the red line is flat and the residuals are evenly distributed
around zero as it indicates constant variance. In this plot, the red
line is fairly flat, suggesting that the variance of the residuals might
be relatively constant. Most residuals are clustered near zero,
especially around the center of the distribution of fitted values,
meaning the model is making accurate predictions on average. However,
the spread of residuals increases slightly for higher fitted values,
suggesting potential issues with variance in these areas.

The model shows a reasonable level of homoscedasticity as indicated by
the mostly flat trend in the red line across the range of fitted values.
However, the presence of potential outliers suggests that there may be a
few instances that don't follow the typical pattern or levels of
heteroscedasticity.

The histograms below display the key indicators of the education domain
in the Northeast and South region. These indicators include adult
education attainment, AP enrollment, college enrollment, early child
enrollment, early childhood education centers, high quality early
childhood education centers, high school graduation rate, 3rd grade math
proficiency, 3rd grade reading proficiency, and school poverty.

Finally, the distribution key indicators of the health and environment
domain in the Northeast and South region are visualized. These
indicators include airborne microparticles, food access, green space
access, health insurance, extreme heat exposure, and industrial
pollutants in air, water, or soil.
