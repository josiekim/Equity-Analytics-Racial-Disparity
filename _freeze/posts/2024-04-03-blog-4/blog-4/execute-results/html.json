EDA revealed intriguing patterns and raised essential questions, steering the direction of our research and model development. In this post, we'll share our process, our initial thoughts and result for the modelling.\n\n# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n\nThe goal of our EDA this week was to understand our dataset more deeply and identify any potential issues that could affect our modeling efforts. Here are the key steps we took:\n\n## figure/table/output 1\n\nWe first examined the breath of our data (looking at relationships among many different variables or groupings).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n\n## figure/table/output 2\n\nAnother interesting aspect we looked at was the depth of our data (developing a better understanding of a specific relationship and how other variables fit in).\n\n# Modelling\n\nWhat response variable are you interested in? What predictor variables? Are there transformations of columns that youâ€™d need to do to create interesting predictors? What type of model do you want to fit? Linear? Logistic? Or something else?\n\n## \n\n",
